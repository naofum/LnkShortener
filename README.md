## Use
LnkShortener is working out of the box. Simply share a link via the share function of your browser or any other app with LnkShortener and it will instantaneously display a shortened URL. 
If you have a workin polr installation enable the API and obtain an API-Key. Open the Settings in LnkShortener and enter the address of your Polr server (e.g. https://1n.pm) including the protocol (e.g. https://). Afterwards copy and paste the API-Key to the next field and you're ready to go with your own domain.

## Using 1n.pm
If you don't have your own polr server there's still the possiblity to keep on using 1n.pm. If you want to receive analytics and click counts you need to [sign up](https://1n.pm/signup). After activating your account (please check your spam folder since the activation e-mail might have ended up there) you can [login](https://1n.pm/login) with your credentials. 
In the righthandside corner there's a new drop-down menu with your username. From the drop-down choose [Dashboard](https://1n.pm/admin). On the next page select [Developer](https://1n.pm/admin#developer). Finally there is your API Key. Copy & Paste it into the API Key field in LnkShorteners Settings.

Finally after all every Link you shorten via the LnkShortener App will be saved on your 1n.pm account and available for analytics. In order to see your history visit the [Dashboard](https://1n.pm/admin) and choose [Links](https://1n.pm/admin#links).

This generally should work for every polr installation *as long as public sign up and analytics were activated by the administrator*.

# Contribute
Contribution is always welcome. On the [Projects Page](https://github.com/michaelachmann/LnkShortener/projects/1) there is a ToDos board with a schedule for the upcoming releases.
